Broken Authentication,Application,"The process of confirming the identity or veracity of an object is known as authentication. With many IoT devices in smart environments lacking strong authentication mechanisms or access control, it becomes easy for attackers to impersonate a legitimate user and use credentials or any other information that grants them access to exploit and discover security vulnerabilities in web applications."
Buffer Overflow,Application,"Buffer overflow occurs when a program or process attempts to write more data into a fixed-length block of memory, or buffer, than the buffer was designed to hold."
Centralized architecture,Network,"Architecture design that centralizes control and decision-making at a single central point. This means that all information from IoT devices is sent to this central point, where it is processed and actions are taken. Devices connected to the IoT transmit processing requests and data information from their sensors directly back to the data center, where information processing and storage are performed by servers running specific applications via switches."
Channel Interference,Network,"Susceptibility of IoT devices to electromagnetic or signal interference in their communication channels. These interferences can occur in various forms and may compromise the integrity and reliability of communications between IoT devices. Jamming attacks are availability attacks against the wireless medium or outward-facing sensors, where an interference device can be used to block the device's sensors from receiving signals."

Default Configuration,Device,"Often, default settings assigned by device manufacturers benefit the company rather than their users. Manufacturers frequently add or enable features that are not essential for the device's operation, which aids attackers in launching their attacks. These settings should be checked and changed immediately after purchasing and setting up the device. Default login settings of IoT devices can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to the device or to reset the password."
Device Spoofing,Device,"Device spoofing refers to a technique in which an attacker disguises their device to appear as a legitimate or trusted device on a network or system. The goal is to deceive network administrators, security systems, or other devices into granting unauthorized access or privileges to the attacker. The attacker typically manipulates or falsifies identification information, such as MAC addresses, IP addresses, or device identifiers, to mask their device as another trusted device."
Eavesdropping,Network,"Interception and monitoring of communications between IoT devices and management systems, without the knowledge or consent of legitimate users. This can occur at various points in device communication, primarily during wireless data transmissions. Since IoT devices transmit information wirelessly, it's easier to intercept the transmitted signals, even if the IoT devices are physically secured."
Electromagnetic Emanations Leaking,Device,Electromagnetic Emanation resulting from information processing within devices.

Insecure Update Mechanisms,Network,"Failures in firmware, software, or other parts of IoT devices and network infrastructure updates. These update mechanisms are crucial for fixing security flaws, adding new features, and ensuring the proper performance of devices. IoT-connected resources have an increased demand for updates, and the frequency of messages causes latency, resulting in network vulnerabilities."
Insufficient Testing,Device,Most IoT devices are rapidly produced to meet the growing market demands and thus may not undergo adequate testing or adhere to any acceptable security standards or evaluation frameworks. These devices may not have been tested as rigorously as desktop/server operating systems.
Knowledge the System,Peopleware,"For system knowledge vulnerability, we have two reference points: the attacker's perspective, as they are aware of the system's weaknesses and employ malware or appropriate intrusion techniques, and the user's perspective, considering the growing innovation of IoT technologies, where many users still need to understand how modern IoT devices are designed and function to better protect themselves."
Lack of Active Device Monitoring,Application,"The absence of a robust system to continuously monitor the status, behavior, and activities of IoT devices on the network. Monitoring IoT devices can be challenging. This is because most existing monitoring tools and practices, especially those focused on the cloud, have traditionally been designed to monitor time-series metric data without a focus on modern IoT devices or their processes. The lack of active IoT device monitoring tools makes it difficult to achieve full network visibility in IoT-based smart environments."
Lack of Proper Authentication Mechanisms,Network,"The absence or inadequacy of mechanisms that verify the identity and permissions of entities, such as devices, users, or services, attempting to access or interact with the network. Authentication is a fundamental security mechanism that ensures only authorized entities have access to the network and its resources."

Lack of Strong Authentication,Device,"An authentication protocol should be developed to confirm mutual trust between different objects, users, or systems by verifying their identities. This prevents an attacker from accessing the device without providing the correct credentials, bypassing authentication mechanisms, and gaining control over the device."
Lack of Strong Password,Network,"The absence or improper use of strong and secure passwords for authentication and access control within the network. Passwords serve as a primary means of verifying the identity of users, devices, or services attempting to access the IoT network or its resources."
Lack of Technical Support,Peopleware,"The absence or insufficient availability of resources, expertise, and assistance to deal with technical issues or provide guidance for IoT devices and networks. When there's a lack of technical support, users of IoT systems may encounter difficulties in configuration, troubleshooting, or maintaining their devices and networks."
Lack Secure Communication Protocols,Network,"The lack or improper use of protocols that ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data transmitted between IoT devices, services, and backend systems. If secure communication protocols are not in place, this introduces significant security risks."
Low Computing Power,Device,"IoT devices often have limited resources, meaning they may have to rely on less robust operating systems and network protocols, making them easier to compromise. On the other hand, they collect sensitive information, exacerbating the risk. Limited processing capacity causes traditional security methods to suffer various setbacks and often fail to detect physical threats on the network."
Low Data Transmission Range,Device,Devices with low data transmission range are susceptible to attacks because they require proximity to other devices to exchange data. This means that an attacker can easily infiltrate the range of these devices to carry out proximity attacks.
