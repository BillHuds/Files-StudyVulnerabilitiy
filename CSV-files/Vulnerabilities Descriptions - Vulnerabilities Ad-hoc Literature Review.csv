Vulnerabilities Ad-hoc,Description
Account Lockout,Allowing authentication attempts after 3 - 5 login attempts even after sequences of failed attempts.
Application vulnerabilities,"Recognizing that software contains vulnerabilities in the first place is an important step in securing IoT devices. Software bugs can make it possible to trigger functionality on the device that was not intended by the developers. In some cases, this could result in the attacker running their own code on the device, making it possible to extract sensitive information or attack other parties."
Incorrect access control,"The services offered by an IoT device should only be accessible by the owner and people in their immediate environment whom they trust. However, this is often insufficiently enforced by a device's security system. IoT devices can trust the local network to such a degree that no further authentication or authorization is required."
Insecure 3rd party components,"Associated with the use of third-party software, libraries, devices, or services that contain security flaws or known vulnerabilities. This can occur when IoT device manufacturers utilize third-party components in their products without properly assessing the security of these components or without keeping these components updated with the latest security patches."
Insecure Data Transfer and Storage,Data that IoT devices receive or transmit over networks needs to be secured and restricted from unauthorized users. This is critical to maintaining the integrity and reliability of IoT applications and organizations' decision-making processes.
Insecure Default Settings,"IoT devices, like personal devices, come with default, hard-coded configurations that allow for simple configuration. However, these default settings are highly insecure and easy for attackers to crack. Once compromised, hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in a device's firmware and launch broader attacks against businesses."
Insecure Ecosystem Interfaces,Insecure ecosystem interfaces such as application programming interfaces (APIs) and mobile and web apps allow attackers to compromise a device. Organizations need to implement authentication and authorization processes that validate users and secure their cloud and mobile interfaces. Handy identity tools help the server differentiate valid devices from malicious users.
Insecure Network Services,"Unnecessary or insecure network services that run on devices, particularly those that are exposed to the internet, jeopardize the availability of confidentiality, integrity/authenticity of information, and open up the risk of unauthorized remote control of IoT devices. Unrequired open ports and services that transmit information over your networks should be inspected and consider removing or disabling as a security measure (if not required)."
Insecure or Outdated Components,"The IoT ecosystem can be compromised by code and software vulnerabilities and legacy systems. The use of insecure or outdated components, such as open source code or third-party software, can introduce vulnerabilities that expand an organization's attack surface."
Insecure Update Mechanisms,"Devices with insecure update processes are at risk of installing malicious or unauthorized code, firmware, and software. Corrupt updates can compromise IoT devices, which can be critical for organizations in the energy, healthcare and industrial sectors. Updates need to be secure and on encrypted channels, while all software must be validated and approved."
Insufficient Physical Security,"If attackers have physical access to a device, they can open the device and attack the hardware. For example, by reading the contents of memory components directly, any protection software can be bypassed. In addition, the device may have debug contacts, accessible after opening the device, which provide an attacker with additional possibilities."
Insufficient Privacy Protection,"User personal information stored on the device or ecosystem that is used insecurely, inappropriately, or without permission."
Intrusion ignorance,"When a device is compromised, it often continues to function normally from the user's point of view. Any additional bandwidth or power usage usually goes undetected. Most devices do not have logging or alerting functionality to notify the user of any security issues."
Lack of Device Management,"One of the most challenging tasks to minimize risk is managing all the devices and closing the perimeter. Device scanning and profiling allows security teams to gain visibility into their IoT devices across networks, thus considering their risks, behavior, activity, and so on."
Lack of encryption,"When a device communicates in plain text, all information being exchanged with a client device or backend service can be obtained by a 'Man in the Middle'. Anyone who is able to get a foothold on the network path between a device and its endpoint can inspect network traffic and potentially obtain sensitive data such as login credentials. Even when data is encrypted, weaknesses can be present if encryption is not complete or configured incorrectly."
Lack of Trusted Execution Environment,"Most IoT devices are effectively general-purpose computers that can run specific software. This makes it possible for attackers to install their own software that has functionality that is not part of the normal functioning of the device. By limiting the device's functionality and the software it can run, the possibilities of abusing the device are limited. To limit the software a device can run, code is typically signed with a cryptographic hash."
Lack of Two-factor Authentication,Lack of two-factor authentication mechanisms like a security token or fingerprint scanner
Manipulating the code execution,With the help of a JTAG adapter and gdb we can modify the firmware running on the device and bypass almost all software-based security controls. Side channel attacks can also modify the execution flow or can be used to leak interesting device information
Obtaining console access,"By connecting to a serial interface, we will gain full console access to a device. Security measures often include custom bootloaders that prevent the attacker from entering single-user mode, but these can also be bypassed."
Outdated software,"As vulnerabilities in software are discovered and resolved, it is important to distribute the updated version to protect against the vulnerability. This means that IoT devices must ship with updated software without any known vulnerabilities, and that they must have update functionality to fix any vulnerabilities that become known after device deployment."
Overly large attack surface,"Every connection that can be made to a system presents a new set of opportunities for an attacker to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. The more services a device offers, the more services it can attack. IoT software systems often involve complex interactions between devices, servers, cloud services, and other components. The more complex the software, the larger the attack surface, due to the increased likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities."
TCP/IP Stacks,"Vulnerabilities affecting TCP/IP stacks – communication protocols commonly used in IoT devices – relate to Domain Name System (DNS) implementations, which can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) or RCE (Remote Code Execution) by attackers ."
Update Location Writable,"Storage location for update files is world-writable, allowing firmware to be modified and distributed to all users"
User interaction,"Vendors can encourage secure deployment of their devices by making it easy to configure them securely. By paying due attention to usability, design, and documentation, users can be encouraged to configure secure configurations."
Username Enumeration,"The ability to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the authentication mechanism through repeated login attempts or API queries. This vulnerability can be exploited through brute-force techniques or through more sophisticated methods, such as error message analysis or system behavior."
Vendor security posture,"When security vulnerabilities are found, the vendor's reaction greatly determines the impact. The vendor has a role to receive information about potential vulnerabilities, develop a mitigation and update devices in the field. The vendor's security posture is often determined by whether the vendor has a process in place to properly handle security issues."
Weak Passwords,"Weak or hardcoded passwords are among the most frequent methods attackers use to compromise IoT devices. Weak, reused passwords that are short or easy to guess are simple for attackers to crack, which they use to compromise devices and launch large-scale attacks."
